## Prototype

## Notes
- When the user places an order in the manager mode we won't copy the order to any following investors since we don't keep track of them in the prototype
- We decide to use the TradingView cloud in the prototype
- We are likely to skip the performance fee or randomly calculate when the manager's order is filled by using this formula `random(up to 10%) * order profit * number of followers`
